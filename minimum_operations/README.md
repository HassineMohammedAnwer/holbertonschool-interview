First, we check if n is less than or equal to 0, in which case we return 0 because it's impossible to have negative or zero characters.

Initialize the operations variable to 0, which will keep track of the number of operations needed.

Next, we use a while loop to iterate from 2 to n. We use i as the factor that we use to divide n.

Within the while loop, we use another while loop to divide n by i as long as n is divisible by i. In each iteration, we add i to the operations variable, and divide n by i.

Once n is no longer divisible by i, we increment i by 1 and repeat the process.

Finally, we add n to the operations variable, which is the result of any remaining division.

We return the result as an integer.
